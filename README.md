# üß† GPT-2 From Scratch

This project is a simplified, educational implementation of **GPT-2** ‚Äî a powerful **Large Language Model (LLM)** developed by OpenAI ‚Äî built entirely from scratch using the Transformer architecture.

## üìö What are LLMs?

**LLMs (Large Language Models)** are advanced artificial intelligence models designed to understand and generate human-like text. They are trained on vast amounts of textual data and can perform a variety of language tasks, such as:

- Answering questions
- Summarizing text
- Translating languages
- Generating creative content

LLMs leverage deep learning techniques to capture the complexities and nuances of human language.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What are Transformers?

**Transformers** are a type of neural network architecture introduced in the paper _‚ÄúAttention is All You Need‚Äù_ by Vaswani et al. (2017). They revolutionized natural language processing by introducing a mechanism called **self-attention**, which allows the model to:

- Weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, regardless of their position
- Efficiently process sequences in parallel
- Scale to very large models

Transformers are the foundation of most modern LLMs, including all versions of GPT.

## ü§ñ What is GPT-2 and Its Components?

**GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2)** is a large language model developed by **OpenAI**. It is based on the Transformer architecture and is designed to generate coherent, contextually relevant text given an input prompt. GPT-2 is pre-trained on massive textual data and can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks.

### üß© Key Components of GPT-2:

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts input tokens (words or subwords) into dense vector representations.
- **Transformer Blocks**: A stack of identical layers, each including:
  - **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Enables the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
  - **Feed-Forward Neural Network**: Applies non-linear transformations to the output of the attention layer.
  - **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections**: Improve training stability and convergence.
- **Output Layer**: Maps the processed hidden states back to vocabulary logits for prediction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

### 1. Understanding the Problem and Setting Objectives
- Defined the goal: to implement, pre-train, and fine-tune a GPT-2 style language model for various NLP tasks.
- Researched the architecture and requirements for LLMs and Transformers.

### 2. Preparing the Environment
- Set up a Python virtual environment for package management and isolation.
- Installed necessary libraries such as **PyTorch**, **NumPy**, and others required for deep learning and data processing.

### 3. Dataset Collection and Preparation
- Gathered relevant text datasets for pre-training and fine-tuning (e.g., SMS Spam Collection, custom instruction datasets).
- Processed and formatted the datasets into suitable forms (e.g., tokenized text, CSV/TSV files).

### 4. Implementing the GPT-2 Model
- Developed the core GPT-2 model architecture using **PyTorch**:
  - Embedding layers
  - Transformer blocks
  - Output layers
- Configured model parameters (e.g., number of layers, hidden size) based on available resources and desired model size.

### 5. Pre-Training the Model
- Wrote scripts to train the model from scratch on large text corpora.
- Implemented data loaders and training loops to efficiently feed data to the model.
- Monitored training progress and saved model checkpoints.

### 6. Fine-Tuning for Downstream Tasks
- Adapted the pre-trained model for specific tasks such as **text classification** or **instruction following**.
- Fine-tuned the model on labeled datasets, adjusting hyperparameters as needed.

### 7. Evaluation and Testing
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics:
  - Accuracy for classification
  - Perplexity for language modeling
- Tested the model on unseen data to ensure generalization.

### 8. Experimentation with Decoding Strategies
- Explored different text generation methods:
  - Greedy decoding
  - Beam search
  - Sampling (e.g., top-k, nucleus)

### 9. Saving and Exporting Models
- Saved trained and fine-tuned model weights for reuse.
- Documented model configurations, training logs, and performance summaries.
